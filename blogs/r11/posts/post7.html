			It has been quite a tiring but successful week in Room 11.  The main focus has been research into Particle Theory.  In this topic people have gone as individuals or groups of two and have been researching main questions that Mr Klenner has set up.  These questions include things like - What is matter, What is the relationship between particles and matter, What is an atom?  We have to complete these questions first - going into as much detail as possible before writing our own mini investigation.  This will lead us into our Science Fair which we will do later in the term.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Another thing we have been doing is creative writing.  For our writing, we have been looking at the book Fahrenheit 451 and inspiring our writing on it.  Like Fahrenheit 451 our writing had to be science fiction.  We looked at what qualities science fiction has and what our writing had to have to be science fiction.  One of the tools Mr Klenner has been teaching us is foreshadowing.  This is where we drop clues in our writing about what is to come.  Fahrenheit 451 uses this a lot.

			Here is an excerpt from some Writing by Paxton Hall and Luke Geddes:
		    </p>
		    <blockquote>
			Suddenly, without any warning, a sky-blue coloured car smashed the back of the one Finley was in. Losing control, his car spun off the road, and into the grass.
	He had gotten last place.
	“This isn’t 2020,” Azure muttered to Finley. “We really shouldn’t be playing video games as old as this. Maybe we could play a faster game,” she added.
	Finley was still annoyed that he had lost. Standing up, he glanced around the blank, white room, empty apart from the small 105-inch television.
	“No thanks, how about a glidescooter around town? Maybe we can experience less 2020 and more 2031,” replied Finley.
		    </blockquote>
		    <p>
			To have a look at everyone’s full story you can pop in and view them when they are finished (hopefully in a couple of weeks).
		    </p>
		    <p>
			The last notable thing we have been doing is badminton.  It has been a lot of fun and everyone is learning quickly.  One of the hardest things is judging when the shuttlecock is going to come down (and land on your racquet).  It is very hard when a draft of wind comes through and blows the shuttlecock off course!
		    </p>
		    <p>
			To sum it up, we have had a week of fun, new learning and productivity.  The Room 11 group is marching forward knocking any obstacles in their way, out of their way!
